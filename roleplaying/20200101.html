        face="Arial">This is the third and final of a series of essays
        on naming your character. This time, I want to talk about how to
        craft a name that stands out and is easy for other players to
        remember while also being difficult for them to mangle.
        Unfortunately, GemStone has been around for 31 years now, and I
        can recall only one name purge during that time. This means it's
        harder than ever to create a unique and memorable name for your
        character -- however, it's far from impossible.<br>
        <br>
        What makes a name unique and memorable?<br>
        <br>
        <i>It's short</i><i>- or medium-length</i><br>
        <br>
        Obviously, there are some great long names out there, and if
        that's what you're envisioning for your character, I say go for
        it. A name like Dellavalondria can be beautiful, and something
        like Krithkashkhor does a great job of conveying "dark and
        harsh." However, no one can deny that, all other things being
        equal, names that the eye can take in at a glance are much
        easier to absorb, remember, and repeat. Some examples include
        Uldwin, Meywen, Runks, and Phlosis.<br>
        <br>
        <i>It's spelled intuitively</i><br>
        <br>
        Since most of us have been reading English for decades, our
        brains have an idea of what order letters are supposed to go in,
        and names will feel "wrong" if that order is off. When you're
        trying out name alternatives in the character manager, watch out
        for names like Drutehrford or Bullraor, which not only look like
        misspellings but may leave other players confused about how the
        name is supposed to be pronounced; the brain tries to turn them
        into the expected "Drutherford" and "Bullroar," which they are
        not.<br>
        <br>
        <i>It's easy to figure out how it's pronounced</i><br>
        <br>
        There's no rule saying that people have to be able to figure out
        how your character's name should be pronounced. However, words
        are easier to remember when we're able to say them in our heads.
        Additionally, you might enjoy knowing that other players have
        the same idea of how your character's name is pronounced as you
        do. This is especially important when all or part of your
        character's name is similar to an already-existing word in
        English. For an example, take the name Vilevar. If you'd meant
        for this name to be pronounced "VILL - eh - var," the idea that
        other players may be pronouncing it "VILE - var" in their heads,
        and possibly making assumptions about your character because of
        it, is probably not a welcome one. The name Villivar would be
        better in this case. When deciding on a name, think of all the
        ways it could be pronounced, and decide if others are likely to
        have a different take on it than the one you wish them to have.
        <br>
        <br>
        <i>It doesn't look like a "second choice" name</i><br>
        <br>
        So many names in GemStone were clearly not the player's first
        choice. How can we tell? They've got doubled letters or extra Hs
        or Es in places that don't make sense, or are perhaps
        conspicuously missing a vowel where there ought to be one. These
        are names like </font><font face="Arial"><span>Sephirroth</span>,
        Lheonardo, Guenivverre, Crstal, etc. Choosing such a name is
        like wearing a sign that says "I didn't get the name I wanted"
        for the rest of your character's life. (Never mind that, often,
        these names are derived from popular book or movie character
        names and thus would be out-of-character for GS.) <br>
        <br>
        If you can't get the name you want, avoid jamming "extra"
        letters or Hs in like the plague. Instead, change letters to
        create something unique. If your desired name Greshnor is
        unavailable, avoid Greshnorr and go for something like Grishnor
        or Greshvor instead. If you can't get Evandriel, go for
        Evyndriel or Evantriel rather than Evanndriel. Martos can become
        Marxos instead of Mahrtos.<br>
        <br>
        When coming up with names for my characters, before I ever enter
        the character manager, I write down the name I want. Then I come
        up with several acceptable alternatives and put them in order in
        terms of how much I like them. Once I get to the naming part of
        character creation, I simply try one name after another until I
        get one that's available. This prevents me getting impatient and
        settling for something I don't really want in order to get out
        of the "mangler" and into the game.</font><font face="Arial"><font

          <br>
        </font>Before I conclude this essay, I have a couple final tips
        for choosing your character's name. They may not help you be
        memorable, but they'll at least keep you from tearing your hair
        out.<br>
        <br>
        <i>Be sure the name's obvious nicknames, if any, are acceptable
          to you</i><br>
        <br>
        Typing is hard, and people like to use nicknames. This may
        become uncomfortable if your character's name is something like
        Cudinius, or Assantra, or </font><font face="Arial"><font
          face="Arial">Gaylforce, so it's something to think about. </font>This
        advice goes double for long names, because if your character is
        named Deztruvenerabla, no one is going to want to type that out;
        be prepared to be called "Dez" or "Dezy" by half the people in
        the game. </font><font face="Arial"><span>Likewise for
          difficult-to-pronounce names like Zpryzhka.</span> <br>
        <br>
        <i>Be sure it doesn't start with the same letters as a common
          type of creature</i><br>
        <br>
        If your character's name starts with "Gol," "Orc," or "Tro,"
        you're going to have to be careful out there (See <a
          href="https://gsguide.fandom.com/wiki/Master_Creature_List">this
          page</a> and sort by family to get an idea of exactly how much
        danger you're in.) Also, unless you enjoy close contact with
        strangers, you might want to skip names that start with "Am";
        just sayin'.<br>
