      of Melissa 3000</BIG></BIG></BIG>
      <P>
      ST. LOUIS--Simutronics Corp. made headlines yesterday with the unveiling
      of their new product manager model, the sleek Melissa 3000.
      <P>
      "It is our belief that this new Melissa 3000 model will be able to do everything
      the old Melissa could, along with several new behaviors we're very excited
      about," said Fred Higgins, head of Simutronics public relations.&nbsp;"By
      replacing our product manager with a superior yet very lifelike android,
      we are confident that we can bring our customers the kind of service they
      have come to demand."
      <P>
      The new Melissa model is physically based off the previous one, though the
      high-tech polyurethane android is reportedly "even hotter," in the words
      of Higgins.&nbsp;"We made her two inches taller and moved her up to a D-cup,
      which we think will really make a big difference in customer relations."
      <P>
      Simutroncs' stock prices have increased threefold since the
      announcement.&nbsp;Wall Street was cautious, yet optimistic. "This is a very
      exciting development from Simutronics," said Mark Dennison, an investor with
      Fidelity.&nbsp;"To our knowledge, this is the first time a company has bucked
      the standard that its customer service staff be 'only human,' an outdated
      paradigm customers have come to resent."
      <P>
      The Melissa 3000 is outfitted with a searingly fast 2.7 gigahertz processor
      that will allow her to perform several tasks impossible with the earlier
      model. For instance, starting in September the Melissa 3000 will personally
      respond to each of the over two thousand missives posted daily to the popular
      GemStone III message boards.
      <P>
      The buzz among players is palpable.&nbsp;"This is pretty cool," said Martha
      Whitewater, a four-year subscriber to Simutronics services.&nbsp;"I was kind
      of upset when I heard she wouldn't have an automatic suggestion implementer,
      but I guess they're working on it."
      <P>
      Simutronics does in fact have a number of projects in development.&nbsp;The
      Brauden 3000 is nearing completion and is tentatively set for release next
      summer, while several smaller "Host-Bot" models are currently in testing.
      <P>
      "Simutronics has always been on the cutting edge, and this just continues
      that tradition," finished Higgins, over loud applause from the audience.
      "With the advent of super-human, robotic customer service representatives,
      no longer will anyone be able to say we're not in touch with our players."</TD>

      WEHNIMER'S LANDING--Tiriath Bainnes, a Half-Elven warrior of ten trainings,
      declined his partner's offer to return to the Landing for a drink this Feastday
      with the excuse that he was "nae fried yet." "Ye go on to th'tavern, my mind
      nae full," Bainnes was heard to say before decapitating another
      troll.&nbsp;Other things that Bainnes has nae been include "premie," "in
      CoL" and "a wizzie."

      <BIG>Dwarf Uncompensated for Lost Crystal</BIG><BR>
      WEHNIMER'S LANDING--Furii McMackow, a young Dwarven bard of the Landing,
      was in a state of utmost concern this Niiman over the loss of his only black
      crystal. "I had it a week ago," the unfortunate Dwarf explained to GameHost
      Valyxia. "It just disappeared from my cloak." When told that no replacement
      would be offered for his crystal, McMackow became disgruntled. "Do you think
      I pay $30 a month to come here and lose black crystals to your stupid bugs?"
      he asked.&nbsp;"Well? Do you?" GameHost Valyxia was unable to provide an
      answer.

      <BIG>Young Empath Trapped in Tent for Hours</BIG><BR>
      ZUL LOGOTH--Recovering from her ordeal, Human empath Misstykiss Suggarkiss
      spoke to the press today about the three harrowing hours she spent trapped
      in the "Torrigin's Teensi Toys" merchant tent. "There was just no way out,"
      Suggarkiss explained, helping herself to some Elven wine. The refreshments
      were a relief for the young empath, who had had to subsist on nothing but
      small star-shaped cookies and tiny mugs of brandied coffee. Suggarkiss had
      remained trapped until local cleric Dansen Narehorn happened by and escorted
      her out through the tent flap, which Suggarkiss described as "definitely
      not there before." Narehorn and Suggarkiss hit it off after their escape
      from Torrigin's and are set to marry next week.

      <BIG>Sheru Worshipper Secretly Likes Cholen</BIG><BR>
      SOLHAVEN--Solhavenite and Sheru worshipper Torasmus Vord, a Faendryl Rogue
      known about town for his collection of 33 Sheru symbols, talismans and
      statuettes, harbors a soft spot for the cross-dressing god of dance.&nbsp;"He's
      just so full of life. Really fun," said Vord, taking a break from tormenting
      the peglegged cat with a squirt-bottle in a twisted Sheruvian ritual.&nbsp;He
      expressed hope that one day, Sheru and Cholen would come together in a "Fashion
      Alliance" that would wrest the gremlin-slayer sword from the hands of those
      who would abuse it.</TD>
