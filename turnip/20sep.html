                  in the Works</big></big></big>
            <p> ST. LOUIS--In their never-ending quest to improve the
              GemStone IV player experience, Simutronics staff is
              tackling the next area in need of an overhaul: character
              races that get no love. We caught up with GM Wyrom to talk
              about the latest developments. </p>
            <p> "When Erithians were first created, we thought players
              would be drawn to the majesty and mystique of this
              enigmatic, eastern-themed race," he told us. "However, a
              decade and a half later, hardly anyone plays them. We've
              realized that we made some mistakes in developing the race
              -- lore mistakes, geographic mistakes, follicular mistakes
              -- and it's time to correct them." The GameMaster spoke to
              us at length about the changes ahead. "As we brainstormed
              what would have the greatest appeal to players, we kept
              coming back to the idea of 'Badassedness.' What makes a
              race badass? In preparing to badasserate Erithians, we
              looked at anything and everything players seemed to be
              drawn to in the game, and tried to put it together in one
              package. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, we've chosen to rename
              the race 'Darkrithians.'" </p>
            <p> The race will, in fact, be dark, and complexion choices
              in the character manager will be constrained to shades of
              jet, ebon, onyx, black, pitch black, coal black, raven
              black, midnight black, nightmare black, hellfire black,
              oblivion black, and existential black. Darkrithians are,
              said Wyrom, "universally tall; the males are well-muscled,
              and the females are simultaneously busty and willowy. Of
              course, they will have abundant, long, flowing hair.
              Additionally, they will be able to speak three languages
              that no other race can speak, and will be allowed to say
              the word 'fuck' or its derivatives once a day." The one
              thing the re-imagined race will be keeping? Katanas. </p>
            <p> When it comes to mechanics, "It's become clear that
              players value the ability to kill things quickly much more
              highly than defense, often to an extreme degree, so with
              this in mind we've given Darkrithians a +20 bonus to
              strength along with a -20 to both agility and dexterity to
              balance it out. We've added support in the lore for this,
              with the reasoning that Darkrithians are simply too secure
              in their own martial prowess to bother moving out of the
              way. We're confident that this will be a tradeoff players
              will be willing to make." </p>
            <p> Where in Elanthia do Darkrithians come from?
              "Recognizing that races living in desert wastes are by far
              the baddassiest in any game, we knew we wanted to make
              them a product of harsh, unforgiving Rhoska-Tor," said
              Wyrom. "I don't want to drop too many hints, but start
              getting excited for a storyline in which we see
              Darkrithians emerge from a time portal in Rhoska-Tor to
              engage the Faendryl and Dhe'nar in a three-way battle over
              who is the baddest, darkest humanoid in the South. Is that
              not totally dope?" Of course, he confided, the
              Darkrithians will triumph to rule both Sharath and New
              Ta'Faendryl; as a consolation prize, the Faendryl and
              Dhe'nar will be granted Zul Logoth, since "only one player
              appears to be using it at this time." </p>
            <p> Wyrom said he expects the revamped race to be widely
              adopted upon release, with an estimated 80% of players
              rolling up a new Darkrithian character within the first
              month. "And after that, it'll be on to fix up some of the
              other underperforming races. I'm looking at you, Forest
              Gnomes." </p>

              Only Game in Town</big><br>
            WEHNIMER'S LANDING--Last Feastday, local monk Olesstra
            Xylitall found herself at a festive gathering on the
            Landing's North Ring Road. Dozens of adventurers assembled
            with tea and ale to listen to a blood-spattered,
            rune-scarred, fanged woman with glowing empty sockets for
            eyes as she detailed her plans to sacrifice a thousand
            virgins and turn the hamlet of Wehnimer's Landing into a
            smoking hell-pit. Though it was difficult to understand the
            sorceress due to her forked tongue and a voice that rasped
            like steel on cold granite, the general mood was attentive
            and lively. For several hours, attendees whispered quietly
            with friends, swore eternal vengeance, or offered polite
            questions about why the murderess might want to destroy
            their home, and the nefarious sorceress answered as best she
            could. The crowd dispersed peaceably shortly after three in
            the morning. It was the third such meeting that the
            so-called Destruviastra of Morgone had arranged with
            townspeople. When asked why she had come to hear the
            sorceress speak, Xylitall said, "Well, my friends are here.
            She's kind of the only game in town right now so I guess
            this is what we're doing."
            <p> <big>Dude Dies</big><br>
              SOLHAVEN--A dude has died, according to hunting partners
              Niimo Wraithly and Mykall MicDuggins. The two were hunting
              shan recently when they passed victim Shomo Elterberry,
              still alive and bravely taking to battle with a shan
              ranger, before continuing on. Moments later, a disturbance
              in the essense was felt as Shomo met his end. </p>
            <p> "Dude died," said Wraithly.</p>
            <p> "Yea," said McDuggins.</p>
            <p> The partners reported that they continued hunting,
              seeking a crucially important opal-inset platinum tiara.
              When, fifteen minutes later, they passed the spot where
              they had last seen Elterberry, he was nowhere to be found.
              "O well," confided McDuggins to our reporter. "Peeps these
              days don't have any patience."</p>

            <p align="Left"> Dear Mamma Maylan, </p>
            <p> I truly hope you can help me as I am not sure what to
              do. I have come into some wonderful land up in the
              northern portion of Elanith, right on the coast near a
              river and overlooking a bay. It seemed just the right spot
              to build a cottage that I could retire to. Yet every time
              I try to build my home it ends in disaster. It has been
              destroyed by rampaging creatures, fire, floodwaters, and
              ravaging krolvin, taken over by hooligans and later
              destroyed by enemies of said hooligans, and now some
              uppity mayor wants to rezone the area for a flax farm
              while the entire area is infected with horrible plague. I
              am simply at a loss at what to do to stop this endless
              madness so I can build and move into my dream home. Do you
              have any advice for what I should do? </p>
            <p> --Lairepm I. Naton </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p><br>
              Dear Lairepm I. Naton, </p>
            <p> Mister, you'd best get to digging. You dig yourself a
              nice big pit. And now you go ahead and build your fancy
              cottage right in that pit. Do it up right, it's going to
              last this time. When you're done, just go ahead and bury
              the whole cottage. Fill it in completely with dirt and
              rocks; this step is key, so don't skip it! That way it's
              super safe and secure from all enemies. It will even be
              safe from you! Your cottage will live safely underground
              for all eternity, untouched and pure. Anyhoo, invite Mama
              Maylan over for a drink sometime, and I'll admire your
              handiwork. </p>

            <p> Dear Mamma Maylan, </p>
            <p> I have never written to you before but I would really
              like your advice on a sensitive matter. I've suspected for
              a long time that I may have a crush on a cardboard cut-out
              of Naos. I secretly visit his office at night just to
              admire it and, lately, I am overcome with impure thoughts.
              What should I do! </p>
            <p> Yours, concerned </p>
            <p> --RBT </p>
            <p><br>
              Dear RBT, </p>
            <p> Lady, what's the problem here? If a cardboard cut-out
              Naos man catches your eye, I think you should go ahead and
              make your move. What you want to do is get all gussied up
              in your finest dress and put some lipstick on. Bring a
              bottle of wine and some chocolate with you. And you woo
              that cardboard Naos man. You woo him good. When you're
              done, just go to town on the cardboard Naos. You'd be wise
              to make the best of your encounter, because I reckon
              cardboard is pretty fragile. The cardboard Naos man will
              likely not survive your magical night together. But it
              will be worth it! Anyhoo, don't forget to take pictures.
              Mama Maylan wants a copy of those. </p>
