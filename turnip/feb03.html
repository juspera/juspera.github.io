      Dark Alliance Threat</BIG></BIG></BIG>
      <P>
      WASHINGTON, DC--Attorney General John Ashcroft met with the press today to
      announce the rebirth of Operation TIPS (Terrorism Information and Prevention
      System), the program designed to allow citizens an easy means to report
      suspicious or unusual behavior encountered in their everyday activities.
      <P>
      The program, axed last year when the Homeland Security Act was finally passed,
      is being resurrected to deal with the growing threat posed by the Dark Alliance.
      Ashcroft was adamant when he spoke this afternoon in a televised press
      conference.
      <P>
      "Though the opposition forces achieved a great victory with Harith, the fact
      remains that the Dark Alliance still has two pieces of the Griffin Sword,
      and our intelligence indicates that they mean to use them. We must be vigilant."
      <P>
      Under the new TIPS, a toll-free government number has been set up to which
      participants may anonymously phone in suspicious activity any hour of the
      day.
      <P>
      President Bush offered his comments in a statement released at the same time.
      "The Dark Alliance is evil, made up of evil people. They want nothing more
      than to destroy our American way of life. Especially Luukos. His reign of
      terror has gone on far too long. It's time for the forces of Liabo to join
      together and bring an end to this. If you're not with us, you're against
      us."
      <P>
      Before departing, Ashcroft briefly reminded the audience of the threat they
      faced. "The Dark Alliance is made up of Luukos, Sheru, V'Tull and Mularos.
      Their followers and supporters reside not just on Lornon, but have infiltrated
      our daily lives, right down to your next-door neighbor, or the person you
      pass on the street. If we're going to prevent terrorism it has to start at
      home, with each and every one of you."
      <P>
      He cautioned citizens to be on the lookout for any kind of suspicious or
      unusual activity. When pressed to be more specific, Ashcroft mused, "Anything
      that seems to link a person to the Dark Alliance... any kind of strange symbols
      or ritual candles, refusing to pray out loud could be suspicious... going
      out at night, and not telling anyone where, any kind of strange marks on
      the body... visiting websites about the Dark Alliance, porn or pipe bombs...
      any kind of suspicious change in behavior, including drug use, increased
      sexual activity, necromancy, cannibalism, orgies, kidnapping and torture
      or any kind of blood sacrifice involving goats or babies should probably
      be reported."
      <P>
      The American Civil Liberties Union is already up in arms over the reinstatement
      of TIPS. "This is just another kind of witchhunt, and already George W. Bush's
      government is trying to justify it with overuse of the word 'evil' and
      unsupported generalizations about the conditions inside the Dark Alliance,"
      read a statement released at the end of the day. "Not only is 'evil' clearly
      a term used by Bush for no other reason than to arouse moral righteousness
      in the populace, but U.N. inspectors have yet to confirm that the Sheruvian
      faction even has a piece of the sword, let alone that the Alliance intends
      to use them to harm the United States or any other nation.
      <P>
      "If anything, the increased hostility and hysteria rising from the highest
      levels of government only serves the Alliance. We feel John Ashcroft ought
      to have a talk with Ulstram before this goes any further."</TD>
    <TD width=250 VALIGN="Top"><BIG>Sheru Unmoved by Sacrifice of
      GameHost</BIG><BR>
      TA'ILLISTIM--An attempt at communing with the god Sheru ended in disappointment
      this Volnes, when the Lord of Terror failed to respond in any way to the
      attempted sacrifice of GameHost Kedrik. Sheruvian Balantha Lothmore had cleverly
      lured the GameHost to a secluded location with the deceptive assist request
      of "I need help." Host Kedrik barely had time to get out "Hello, Balantha!
      I'm GameHost Kedrik. How may I be of assistance?" before being brutally
      dismembered and offered up to the dark god. Sheru did not seem impressed
      by the sacrifice of this lesser staff member, and before dismissing Host
      Kedrik, Lothmore demanded to be referred to a GM.

      <BIG>Sorcerer Too Scary for Dhe'nar</BIG><BR>
      WEHNIMER'S LANDING--Local Dark Elven sorceror Mhaegol Blastwrath's application
      for apprenticeship to the Obsidian Tower was denied this week, on the excuse
      that he was "just too scary" for the Dhe'nar. Starsnuffer Sunslayer explained.
      "Normally, we like to see Dhe'nar who are 'just scary enough,' but Mhaegol
      exceeds the upper scariness limit in black rune-encrusted clothing, dark
      tones, smirking, waving his hand dismissively, and shifting those piercing
      steel-grey eyes from one person to another." He continued in a lower voice,
      "Frankly, I'm a little afraid of him myself."
      <P>
      <BIG>Vaaloran Vigilance Pays Off</BIG><BR>
      TA'VAALOR--The Vaaloran Guard's effort to keep the fortress clean of Dark
      Alliance supporters has been paying off. Figures from last Restday record
      thirty-six instances of Alliance supporters given stern warnings and sent
      by mage transport to Ta'Illistim on that day alone. A breakdown of the figures
      indicates three Dark Alliance followers were removed; one, eleven, and
      twenty-four times each. When asked about the fantastic totals, Vaaloran Officer
      Ponter offered only his middle finger in response.
      <P>
      <BIG>Decaying Sucks, Studies Show</BIG><BR>
      WEHNIMER'S LANDING--Studies undertaken over the past seven and a half years
      by the Adventurers' Guild of Elanthia have come to the conclusion that decaying
      sucks, a spokesperson said yesterday. "Whether in town or in the wilds, whether
      through the natural process of hunting or through disconnects, whether nobody
      locates or whether the same script-hunter walks by five times as you lie
      there, decaying sucks ass," he announced. "Now that we're done with this
      study, we're going to be embarking on a deep look into the desirability of
      going demonic. We hope to have the results ready in eight&nbsp;to ten years."</TD>
