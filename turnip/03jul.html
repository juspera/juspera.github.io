                  Minister of Information Meets with Press</big></big></big>
            <p> SOLHAVEN--The minister of information for the joined
              forces opposing the Dark Alliance in the war for the
              Griffin Sword spoke this Day of the Huntress to members of
              the press and curious onlookers. </p>
            <p> "Ulstram [Chanerser] is absolutely on top of things as I
              speak. We have the fourth sword piece, it is in a secure
              location," said Minister Rafspite Cathcart. "I will not
              say where, but it is secure." </p>
            <p> By all outside reports, things have been looking grim
              for the Resistance, with three of the alleged four Griffin
              Sword pieces in the hands of the enemy, and Resistance
              leader Ulstram missing in action for months. Resistance
              fighters eager for any news of the top brass's activities
              clustered around the minister as he spoke, peppering him
              with questions about the sword pieces and the Dark
              Alliance. </p>
            <p> "They [the Dark Alliance] don't even have a single sword
              piece," he assured listeners. "They hold no sword pieces.
              This is an illusion... they are trying to sell to you an
              illusion. I have detailed information about the
              situation... that completely proves what they allege are
              illusions. They lie every day. They are Luukosians and
              they are dogs. </p>
            <p> "I can say, and I am responsible for what I am saying,
              that they have started to commit suicide under the walls
              of Vornavis. We will encourage them to commit more
              suicides quickly." </p>
            <p> Minister Cathcart dismissed concerns that Ulstram
              Chanerser was missing or dead. "I have seen him just this
              morning. He is in the Landing and he is in very good
              health. Please, I will not answer ridiculous questions." </p>
            <p> Regarding reports that the Dark Alliance and its
              followers had taken a strong hold on Solhaven and its
              temples, Cathcart was scornful. "I triple guarantee you,
              there are no Dark Alliance followers in Solhaven," he
              said, continuing at length on the moral depravity of the
              enemy. "We have issued a warning to the civilian
              population not to pick up any gems because they are booby
              traps," he said. "They have started dropping those gems,
              but they are not gems, they are booby traps to kill the
              children. Even those who live on another planet, if there
              are such people, would have condemned this action before
              it started. The midget Morvule and that Draezir deserve
              only to be beaten with shoes by freedom loving people
              everywhere." </p>
            <p> Yet the minister remained characteristically upbeat on
              the war's prospects. </p>
            <p> "We have placed them in a quagmire from which they can
              never emerge except dead," he said, adding that both
              Zerroth and Eryael have been killed by resistance forces
              in the past week, as well as "thousands" of Alliance
              troops. "On this occasion, I am not going to mention the
              number of the infidels who were killed and the number of
              destroyed encampments. The operation continues." </p>
            <p> These offerings were met with some doubt by Resistance
              members, whose faith in their mission has dwindled
              steadily with every passing month. Some insisted they be
              allowed to speak with Ulstram in person, while others
              openly doubted whether Ulstram could have the fourth piece
              at all. Cathcart dismissed their concerns. </p>
            <p> "Please, please! The Dark Alliance is relying on what I
              called yesterday a desperate and stupid method. They are
              nowhere near the fourth sword piece... they are lost in
              the desert... they can not read a compass... they are
              retarded. </p>
            <p> "We are not afraid of the Dark Alliance. Koar has
              condemned them. They are stupid. They are stupid... and
              they are condemned. We will slaughter them, Morvule and
              his international gang of bastards!" </p>

              Phoenatos</big><br>
            WEHNIMER'S LANDING--The Riverglade Torture Camp was a-bustle
            this Feastday as it prepared for Phoenatos's influx of
            campers. High Counselor Rilastia Morgovia paused in dragging
            a rack down from an attic to speak with us. "We're expecting
            a big turnout this year due to the Griffin Sword events,"
            she told us. "Either people are just getting into torture or
            they want to brush up their technique." New this year, she
            added, was a 500 silver commission going to the High Priest
            of Mularos for each first-time camp attendee. With the extra
            help, "After this year, we may finally purchase the camp
            some sharper scalpels." Morgovia paused. "Or maybe not."
            <p> <big>Weather Bad in Sapphire Tunnel</big><br>
              ZUL LOGOTH--Weather was bad in Zul Logoth's Sapphire
              Tunnel this afternoon, as local warrior Treyy Difallon was
              waylaid for nearly three minutes by a strange bank of fog
              and rain that had moved in, but rapidly cleared. "Anyone
              else got bad weather?" Difallon was heard to ask over the
              thought net. "I got real bad weather here." Then, "Oh my
              god. Anyone else in a fog? It's really stormin here."
              After the three minutes had passed, Difallon updated the
              town on the weather situation. "Weather's gone," he said
              simply, continuing on to his hunt. </p>
            <p> <big>Wizard Uses WARN Gratuitously</big><br>
              KHARAM-DZU--The Isle of Teras is abuzz this week with
              discontent, as local enchanter Wilo Ackadee takes the act
              of WARNing other townsfolk to a new level. Empath Owna
              Snergin says, "The man stunned me because I refused to
              heal him, then when I kicked him, he warned me for
              interaction." Her companion Trissh Dawnbirds adds, "He
              warned me today after I said Elves were wimps. I wasn't
              even talking to him. I don't even know him." Ackadee
              claims not to remember the Elf comment, saying, "I've
              heard of other people having problems with Trissh, so when
              I saw her today I decided to warn her preemptively."
              Ackadee paused during the interview to warn a stranger
              asking for spells, "just in case." </p>
            <p> <big>Mandis™ Crystal Creator Sues</big><br>
              JANTALAR--Gallister Mandis, creator of the Mandis™
              Crystal, has brought a new lawsuit against the Barony of
              Jantalar. Mandis claims his contract with the Barony
              stipulates that Mandis™ Crystals should be referred to as
              "mana management crystals," must not be resold, and must
              be represented with the Mandis™ trademark and logo in all
              official documents. "We don't have a free empire if the
              big guy can can just run over the little guy like this,"
              said Mandis, speaking through his lawyer Volnes. "I
              deserve better and the Mandis™ deserves better. It's not a
              toy."</p>
