      <P>
      ST. LOUIS--Draezir Moltoniron, High Priest of Sheru, has sued Simutronics
      Corp. of St. Louis for breach of contract, loss of revenue, and a count of
      pain and suffering with damages totalling 2.6 billion silvers.
      <P>
      "Simutronics' actions toward me have been utterly reprehensible and nothing
      short of unlawful," said Draezir, speaking from his office Monday. "Their
      actions show a complete disregard for the law, for business integrity and
      especially for their own customers. It's obvious all they care about is making
      money."
      <P>
      This is the seventy-second lawsuit brought against Simutronics Corp. this
      decade, but the suit remains unique in that it's the only one so far to be
      willingly publicized by the plaintiff. "I want everyone to know what they
      did to me," explained Draezir. "If I get some flak for that, so be it. I
      have to stand up for what's right."
      <P>
      We spoke with Fred Higgins, head of Simutronics public relations. "Mr. Moltoniron
      is upset and wants someone to blame, and we understand that. He had some
      very bad luck, but it's just that: bad luck. In no way is Simutronics at
      fault. There was no breach of contract."
      <P>
      Draezir sent out a press release last Friday claiming that he had signed
      a contract with Simutronics allowing him control of the town of Solhaven
      in the Turamzzyrian Empire, in return for 1 billion silvers and his likeness
      rights in the upcoming movie. However, says the press release, Simutronics
      backed out of the deal shortly after he took control of the town, "abandoning
      him" and "standing by idly" as Solhaven was returned to its original controllers.
      <P>
      The 2.6 billion silvers Draezir is claiming in damages includes the original
      1 billion spent to seal the contract, the price of the troops and provisions
      needed to gain the town, the cost of a "damaged reputation and possible demotion"
      in the Sheruvian Order, and lastly the cost of pain and suffering over the
      incident, which Draezir says is "impossible to really put a price on."
      <P>
      Higgins explains Simutronics' side of the issue. "We absolutely signed a
      contract with Mr. Moltoniron promising him control of the town. If Mr. Moltoniron
      believed the contract entitled him to permanent control of said town, I don't
      know what to say. What exactly the contract promised was very clear. While
      we'd like to go over every word with our clients and make sure there are
      no misunderstandings, that isn't always possible. The final burden for
      understanding rests with the client."
      <P>
      Through his secretary, Draezir today said that he was considering further
      lawsuits against a certain Ulstram and Kendryth for plotting with Simutronics
      in the breach of contract.
      <P>
      "I feel so used," said Draezir, before finally shooing the press from his
      office. "This whole situation with Simutronics is ruining my life. It's been
      a complete nightmare."</TD>

      TA'VAALOR--This weekend, while the rest of the world slept, local warrior
      Ruckle Fastbit stepped out of the background and into legend when he found
      the third piece of the Griffin Sword. "I was looking in the VC and there
      it was, hidden on the bench," Fastbit shared in an excited whisper. "A blue
      sapphire like you get on critters, but it wasn't ON a critter... no one else
      is smart enough to look on top of things in rooms, so who knows how long
      it's been there? Probably since the start of the quest." Fastbit expressed
      that he hadn't yet told anyone of his discovery. "I'm waiting for the NPCs
      to come. I'm going to&nbsp;play them against each other and get all the
      alterations I can before I sell this thing to the gemshop."
      <P>
      <BIG>Corpse Completely Desanguinated</BIG><BR>
      SOLHAVEN--Meegoth Neegoth, a Halfling warrior of Solhaven, was completely
      desanguinated yesterday due to several wounds taken in battle. "Wow," offered
      Neegoth in a ghostly voice. "I'm at -4055 blood. -4067 now actually." When
      told no one wanted to hear about it, Neegoth replied, "OK. I know it's OOC
      but I just had to tell someone. Wow, -5001!"
      <P>
      <BIG>Cleric Gripped by Addiction</BIG><BR>
      WEHNIMER'S LANDING--Half-Elven cleric Sooshi Malarbak has an addiction. It
      came on her slowly at first, but became more and more sinister as time passed,
      until her energy and her bank account were drained by her constant need.
      Sooshi Malarbak is addicted to deeds. "At first I would get nervous if I
      didn't have over fifteen of them. But then it was twenty, then thirty, then
      forty. Now if I have below 150 I can't sleep at night." Malarbak broke out
      in a cold sweat. "I need to get 200. If I only get 200, I'll be fine. I can
      stop there."
      <P>
      <BIG>Ranger Murdered</BIG><BR>
      TA'ILLISTIM--Local ranger Ganvel Torris was forced to report unwanted PvP
      last night when he was killed suddenly and for no discernable reason. Says
      Torris: "I was resting from my hunt and thinking on the net, I wasn't really
      paying attention and all of a sudden I'm dead." Torris paused in the interview
      to kill the glacial morph in front of him, then continued. "After I was raised
      they told me it was some guy named Harith so I reported him. I hope his moron
      ass gets locked out."</TD>
