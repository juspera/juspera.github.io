      Fall Nights" Extravaganza</BIG></BIG></BIG>
      <P>
      ST. LOUIS--Simutronics announced the launch of a new release-packed season
      this Thursday, tentatively titled "Unseasonably Warm Fall Nights," and meant
      to capitalize on the success of the extraordinarily popular Hot Summer Nights
      project (HSN to devotees).
      <P>
      Hot Summer Nights was the official name of the GemStone III release schedule
      for Summer 2002. Many long-awaited new implementations, from cultural titles
      to physical features to enchanting, were put in place over the past few months.
      Each and every weekend involved several of these releases as well as a party
      in one of Elanthia's various towns, and each was met with cheers of surprise
      and delight from the playing populace.
      <P>
      "The enormous success of HSN has resulted in a commitment to bringing you
      these same sort of action-packed galas every weekend of the year," posted
      SGM Brauden in the new UWFN folder of the GemStone III message boards. "We
      know just how much you players loved having something new to look forward
      to every Thursday, and thanks to your input, we've decided we're going to
      continue it indefinitely."
      <P>
      His statement was met with wild virtual applause, though a handful of players
      questioned the staff's ability to keep up the standard of excellence.
      <P>
      "Logically, I'm not sure how they're going to do it," posted OBSESSION on
      the GemStone III message boards. "I believe they worked on HSN for a long
      time in advance, and frankly, I don't see how they can come up with that
      much new stuff again without the time off to plan." Poster TSORAN agreed.
      "HSN was great, but there's no way&nbsp;the Unseasonably Warm releases can
      live up to that standard."
      <P>
      We caught up with GM Altiron chain-smoking his way through a case of vanilla
      cigars behind the staff lounge. He waved us away, insisting that all upcoming
      UWFN releases were top secret. However, when pressed, he let slip that while
      he was assigned the job of coding in an engagement system, at the moment
      he was considering an alternate feature release involving an across-the-board
      reduction of prices in the Sylvarraend clothing shop.
      <P>
      Eager for more, we found GM Mikos hard at work on a keg of Dwarven ale.
      After&nbsp;an hour or so of encouragement&nbsp;directed at the hardworking
      GM, we discovered he was slated to write descriptions for the approximately
      220 rooms involved in the new path from Solhaven to River's Rest. He admitted
      that the path might not be ready in the first week or even the second week
      of UWFN, but that he had a couple of "stellar" releases ready for the weekends
      leading up to it, including a fix for that problem where typing "get ruby"
      will give you the regular ruby in your cloak instead of the star ruby on
      the ground.
      <P>
      The buzz over UWFN is palpable. As of press time, Brauden -- claiming QC
      delays -- had not yet posted to the GS website the list of expected Fall
      improvements,&nbsp;but an unveiling of the blessed schedule is expected to
      occur "real soon now."</TD>
    <TD width=250 VALIGN="Top"><BIG>Landing Invasion Wreaks Widespread
      Apathy</BIG><BR>
      WEHNIMER'S LANDING--A chaotic invasion force of stone and glaes creatures
      left a wake of sheer brutal complacency this week, storming the Landing gates
      to bring waves of apathy and boredom to the suspecting populace. Riotous
      selling of goods erupted on the black net, while platoons of unresponsive
      rest-mode powerhunters beseiged town square. Casual speculation on the average
      level of the invaders was rudely interrupted by stretches of sinister,
      ennui-induced silence. One brave soul breached the emptiness to suggest that
      the invading force "get better script writers," but was soon quieted by the
      overwhelming lack of response. Across the unravaged town tonight, no one
      wonders what will become of us all if this onslaught continues.
      <P>
      <BIG>Alteration Goes Unappreciated</BIG><BR>
      RIVER'S REST--A brand new alteration went unappreciated last week, as ranger
      Ghiara Lastaway removed the gift of some kitten-stitched leather gloves as
      soon as the&nbsp;giver left the room. The gloves (which Millovan Milln had
      stitched especially for Lastaway on making his first alterer's list) bore
      playful thread-of-gold kittens romping in the noonday sun. "I thought that
      was perfect for her, since she has a kitten tattoo on her ankle," said Milln.
      The gloves were delivered with the comment that Milln "really liked, and
      thought about [Lastaway] a lot," and were accepted with a blush and a kiss
      on the cheek. But Lastaway peeled off the gloves as soon as Milln departed,
      saying "It's not really something I'd wear." Before stowing them in her locker,
      Lastaway wondered aloud how much the alteration would bring on the boards.
      <P>
      <BIG>Elf Constantly Sarcastic</BIG><BR>
      WEHNIMER'S LANDING--Elf Brionah Whiteleaf has been irritating friends and
      strangers lately with her new, and constant, sarcastic tone. Reportedly,
      the roguette picked up the tone somewhere around August 23rd "for no good
      reason" and has not spoken without her sneering, nasally twang since. Responding,
      Whiteleaf sarcastically said, "I'm actually glad you noticed." She continued
      sarcastically, "I was pretty excited to finally be able to show it,"
      sarcastically adding that "I've always been sarcastic." In conclusion, she
      noted sarcastically, "If you think about it, things are no different from
      before."
      <P>
      <BIG>Warrior Struggles to Fill Friend List</BIG><BR>
      TA'VAALOR--Warrior Nellus Wrathbane reports that it was a "major struggle"
      to fill up his list of 10 allowed friends. "I put [girlfriend] Kellayna and
      [friend] Poolou on right away, but it took a few days to get the next five."
      Wrathbane says he was finally inspired to put on the names of the four other
      warriors he's trying to form a militia with, as well as that of a healer
      who transferred a hand wound he received hunting kobolds. "But to fill up
      the rest of the list, I eventually had to pick three random people from the
      VC," he says. "It totally sucked when they did the reset though. I had to
      find three more random people." However, Wrathbane happily states that he
      now "has a full ten friends."</TD>
