            Nindy asks, "See?"<br>
            <br>
            Nindy points at an unfinished eagle figurine.<br>
            <br>
            Andraste carves her wand with ease and confidence.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Zyllah, you didn't finish it."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros says, "Including a flaming chicken, apparently."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros asks, "Can you turn into a flaming cow?"<br>

            Mekthros says, "That'd be impressive."<br>

            Andraste grins as her rose miniature begins to take shape.<br>

            rose miniature for everyone to appreciate.<br>

            Zyllah says, "Andraste is a damned show off."<br>

            [Silverwood Manor, Great Hall]<br>
            An ancient modwir marks the center courtyard of this elegant
            manor.&nbsp; Surrounded by an expansive well-manicured lawn,
            the tree towers high overhead, its boughs shading most of
            the area from the sunlight.&nbsp; Melodiously calling from
            somewhere within the branches, a variety of songbirds sing
            in a cheerful chorus.&nbsp; Tall topiaries line the edge of
            the courtyard, adding a sense of privacy to the area.&nbsp;
            The sweet fragrance of wildflowers and herbs, which checker
            the lawn, drifts through the air.&nbsp; You also see a hefty
            wand, a hefty wand, a hefty wand, a hefty wand, a hefty

            Obvious exits: north, south, east, west<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros says, "She didn't have much to show off about ten
            minutes ago."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Make me a cuddly Ulstram miniature."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros says, "But she's getting good."<br>
            <br>
            Zyllah chops awkwardly at a wand with her knife.<br>
            <br>
            Lothwyn grins at you.<br>
            <br>
            Lothwyn whittles quickly and easily, the knife slicing
            through the wand with sure, graceful strokes.<br>

            Andraste drops a delicate rose miniature.<br>

            Zyllah drops an unfinished Charl symbol.<br>

            Desorceri snorts at Zyllah.<br>
            <br>
            Lothwyn glances at Zyllah.<br>
            <br>
            Lothwyn asks, "Not finishing it?"<br>
            <br>
            Nindy says, "You've got to finish what you start, young
            lady."<br>
            <br>
            Nindy exclaims, "That's what gives you GMs a bad rap!"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "It's kind of poetical though."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "The unfinished nature of it..."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "It's symbolic."<br>
            <br>
            Andraste carves her wand with ease and confidence.<br>
            <br>
            Zyllah says, "Everyone's making fun of me."<br>
            <br>
            Lothwyn asks, "What are you looking at me for?"<br>
            <br>
            Zyllah folds her arms over her chest.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Zyllah, thou art a peg-fingered stick-tickler."<br>
            <br>
            Zyllah starts chuckling at you!<br>
            <br>
            Desorceri says, "Look at it this way.&nbsp; There's plenty
            room for improvement."<br>
            <br>
            Lothwyn finishes with a flourish and holds up an exquisite
            iceblossom miniature for everyone to appreciate.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Oh."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Look, there is a Koar symbol."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros says, "So many painful puns can be made between
            whittle and little."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros says, "We seem to have covered most of them."<br>
            <br>
            Nindy exclaims, "I've made thirteen, this far!"<br>
            <br>
            Zyllah dreamily says, "It's Kai."<br>
            <br>
            You chuckle at Zyllah.<br>
            <br>
            You pick up an elaborate Koar symbol.<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "Who made this one?"<br>
            <br>
            Desorceri says, "I think Lothwyn did"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I knew he cared."<br>
            <br>
            Lothwyn says, "Yes, I did."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I was wondering who made the Koar one."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "You made it just for me, didn't you."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros says, "I'll trade you an elaborate Sheru symbol for
            your elaborate Koar symbol."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Lothwyn says, "But you see, it has instructions.&nbsp; It's
            pronounced "Core"."<br>
            <br>
            Lothwyn smirks.<br>
            <br>
            You snort at Mekthros.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Nooo."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "koAR"<br>
            <br>
            Zyllah nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            You attempt to kick at Lothwyn, but he casually sidesteps
            your foot and raises a hand.&nbsp; An unseen force lifts
            your entire body off the ground.&nbsp; As Lothwyn looks
            away, it dawns on you that you're no longer being
            supported.&nbsp; You fall and slam hard into the ground!<br>
            Roundtime: 10 sec.<br>
            <br>
            Zyllah dreamily says, "Er wait."<br>
            <br>
            Nindy says, "No, he's right."<br>
            <br>
            Nindy says, "Core."<br>
            <br>
            Nindy nods.<br>
            <br>
            Zyllah dreamily says, "No...I'm in the core camp."<br>
            <br>
            Zyllah dreamily says, "I'm still talking dreamily."<br>
            <br>
            Zyllah dreamily says, "How embarassing."<br>
            <br>
            Nindy says, "It's cute."<br>
            <br>
            Nindy nods to Zyllah.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "You can't stop thinking about Kai."<br>
            <br>
            Zyllah nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Nindy says, "We're trying to figure out which of us you're
            fantasizing about."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I can't stop thinking about... Ulstram."<br>
            <br>
            You fan yourself.<br>
            <br>
            Andraste starts chuckling at you!<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Oh oh."<br>
            <br>
            Zyllah starts chuckling at you!<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "Is that one wearable?"<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros says, "Those blind prophets.&nbsp; Damn, but the
            hotness."<br>
            <br>
            Zyllah picks up a hefty wand.<br>
            <br>
            Zyllah concentrates intently, but appears to be
            determined.&nbsp; As she painstakingly works the wand with
            her knife, you remind yourself that even the great artists
            had to start somewhere.&nbsp; But what IS she trying to
            create there?<br>
            <br>
            You say, "It is wearable."<br>
            <br>
            You pick up a delicate Koar charm.<br>
            <br>
            You put on a delicate Koar charm.<br>
            <br>
            Nindy says, "Oh."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I want an unfinished Koar charm. I find them very
            symbolical."<br>
            <br>
            Zyllah starts chuckling at you!<br>
            <br>
            You say, "It's like my moral growth."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros says, "You can get your Koar charm altered."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros asks, "You have moral growth?"<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros peers quizzically at you.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "If I altered it, it'd be a rejection of Andraste."<br>
            <br>
            Lothwyn says, "Can I see your charm"<br>
            <br>
            Lothwyn peers quizzically at you.<br>
            <br>
            You take off a delicate Koar charm.<br>
            <br>
            You offer your Koar charm to Lothwyn, who has 30 seconds to
            accept the offer.&nbsp; Type CANCEL to prematurely cancel
            the offer.<br>
            <br>
            Lothwyn has accepted your offer and is now holding a
            delicate Koar charm.<br>
            <br>
            Zyllah says, "She has no charm."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I'm full of charm."<br>
            <br>
            Zyllah says, "She is lacking in charm"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "But here's the one you--"<br>
            <br>
            You glance at Zyllah.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros says, "And no tact, either."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros says, "Alright, she has some tact."<br>
            <br>
            Zyllah starts chuckling at you!<br>
            <br>
            Lothwyn offers you a delicate Ko "CORE" ar charm.&nbsp;
            Enter ACCEPT to accept the offer or DECLINE to decline
            it.&nbsp; The offer will expire in 30 seconds.<br>
            <br>
            Lothwyn says, "There you go."<br>
            <br>
            You accept Lothwyn's offer and are now holding a delicate Ko
            "CORE" ar charm.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Um."<br>
            <br>
            Zyllah begins chuckling at Lothwyn!<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros begins chuckling at Lothwyn!<br>

            Nindy begins chuckling at Lothwyn!<br>
            <br>
            Desorceri laughs!<br>
            <br>
            Livits starts chortling.<br>
            <br>
            You scratch your ear.<br>
            <br>
            Nindy says, "He's right, you know."<br>
            <br>
            Nindy nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros says, "You just got a free 30 second alteration."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros says, "You should be ecstatic."<br>
            <br>
            How can they be so mean to you?!<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Yeah, well."<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "You know Sheru is pronounced SHEE-roo?"<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros says, "Ingrate."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Lothwyn stares at you.<br>
            <br>
            Zyllah glances at you.<br>
            <br>
            Nindy asks, "Isn't it Sure-ooo?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Like Shee-ra."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "He-man's friend."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros glances at you.<br>
            <br>
            Desorceri exclaims, "Cher-Roo!"<br>
            <br>
            Lothwyn asks, "Like Ni-ff?"<br>
            <br>
            Lothwyn tightens his grip on his flexible knife and glances
            over at you.<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "Ni...ff?"<br>
            <br>
            Nindy asks, "Niff?"<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros says, "Blasphemer."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros points at you.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera belches loudly.)<br>
            <br>
            You say, "God, can't wait for september."<br>
            <br>
            Zyllah asks, "Why is that?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "All this time I've had to burp with the act
            command."<br>
            <br>
            Nindy says, "It'll be a new verb in GS4."<br>
            <br>
            Zyllah says, "Ohhh."<br>
            <br>
            Desorceri nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Desorceri says, "me too"<br>
            <br>
            Livits happily asks, "it will?"<br>
            <br>
            Zyllah says, "Yeah, I want that one too."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Of course you do."<br>
            <br>
            Livits happily asks, "i kin belch in gs4?"<br>
            <br>
            Morganwyn asks, "you mean we will have to listen to Nindy
            Burp milk?"<br>
            <br>
            Zyllah's face contorts in concentration as she works her
            knife.&nbsp; From the looks of things, this isn't easy for
            her!<br>
            <br>
            Nindy just nudged Morganwyn.<br>
            <br>
            Livits happily says, "First thing im gonna do is have a
            belching contest in gs4"<br>
            <br>
            You frown at a delicate Ko "CORE" ar charm.<br>
            <br>
            Lothwyn whittles quickly and easily, the knife slicing
            through the wand with sure, graceful strokes.<br>
            <br>
            Nindy says, "Poor, Zyllah."<br>
            <br>
            Zyllah wiggles her eyebrows.<br>
            <br>
            Zyllah says, "A stallion."<br>
            <br>
            Zyllah offers Lothwyn an unfinished stallion figurine.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros says, "Tell us again how one pronounces "Koar"."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Nindy says, "Correction."<br>
            <br>
            Nindy says, "An unfinished stallion."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "KoAR"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Or Kwar."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "If you say it fast, you know."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros turns an inquisitive ear towards you.<br>
            <br>
            Lothwyn peers quizzically at Zyllah.<br>
            <br>
            Lothwyn says, "Finish it."<br>
            <br>
            Zyllah whines.<br>
            <br>
            Nindy begins chuckling at Lothwyn!<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros says, "Ah yes.&nbsp; You can be JusPEEra, then."<br>
            <br>
            Desorceri says, "Co-wer"<br>
            <br>
            Lothwyn tries to pull you towards him.<br>
            <br>
            Lothwyn says, "Fine, give."<br>
            <br>
            Nindy asks, "JusPEEra?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Lady Nindy."<br>
            <br>
            Desorceri exclaims, "Cower before Koa-er!"<br>
            <br>
            You offer your Koar charm to Lothwyn, who has 30 seconds to
            accept the offer.&nbsp; Type CANCEL to prematurely cancel
            the offer.<br>
            <br>
            Lothwyn has accepted your offer and is now holding a
            delicate Ko "CORE" ar charm.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Heck."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Lady Lothwyn."<br>
            <br>
            Lothwyn offers you a delicate Koar charm.&nbsp; Enter ACCEPT
            to accept the offer or DECLINE to decline it.&nbsp; The
            offer will expire in 30 seconds.<br>
            <br>
            You accept Lothwyn's offer and are now holding a delicate
            Koar charm.<br>
            <br>
            A roaring ball of fire streaks through the air and strikes
            you!<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; ... 10 points of damage!<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Burst of flames to head catches ears on
            fire!&nbsp; Yeeoww!<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; You are stunned for 1 round!<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            You are still stunned.<br>
            <br>
            Desorceri chuckles.<br>
            <br>
            Spaewife laughs!<br>
            <br>
            You are still stunned.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "ow"<br>
            <br>
            Morganwyn cringes.<br>
            <br>
            You are healed.<br>
            <br>
            Nindy says, "That looked fun."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "You could have made it an... unfinished Koar
            charm."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "SIR Lothwyn."<br>
            <br>
            (Mekthros slaps Juspera on the side of the head, apparently
            attempting to extinguish her ear.)<br>
            <br>
            You say, "If only I could kick you here."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros says, "Your ear.&nbsp; It was burning."<br>
            <br>
            Nindy says, "You missed."<br>
            <br>
            Nindy nods to Mekthros.<br>
            <br>
            Zyllah grins smugly.<br>
            <br>
            Nindy says, "Have at it again."<br>
            <br>
            Nindy says, "It's still smoking, you see."<br>
            <br>
            Zyllah bites her tongue, looking a little silly, but you can
            see that she is getting some decent results with her
            whittling this time.<br>
            <br>
            Zyllah grins smugly.<br>
            <br>
            Zyllah says, "Er..."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros says, "Wait, both of her ears are smoking."<br>
            <br>
            Lothwyn glances at Zyllah.<br>
            <br>
            Lothwyn taps a lovely lute miniature.<br>
            <br>
            Lothwyn taps an unfinished mournbloom miniature.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I had a violin miniature. I don't know if I still
            have it. But Amadeus gave it to me when he left."<br>
            <br>
            Zyllah finishes with a flourish and holds up a quaint lizard
            figurine for everyone to appreciate.<br>
            <br>
            Lothwyn asks, "You leaving unfinished ones again?"<br>
            <br>
            Nindy says, "It's quaint."<br>
            <br>
            Nindy nods to Zyllah.<br>
            <br>
            Nindy says, "Good for you."<br>
            <br>
            Livits happily says, "i has to admit, most the things the
            gms have put together in the past were fun"<br>
            <br>
            Livits happily asks, "whos idea was landin gettin takin over
            by the jants?"<br>
            <br>
            You put on a delicate Koar charm.<br>
            <br>
            Your attempt at a cartwheel is an utter failure, and you end
            up sprawled unceremoniously on the ground.<br>
            Roundtime: 5 sec.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Er."<br>
            <br>
            Zyllah laughs at you!<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Sorry, I was thinking about Ulstram again."<br>
            <br>
            Zyllah says, "It was Hochstib's idea."<br>
            <br>
            Morganwyn says, "no no...warped was having the troll kings
            sit in all the rt spots on the EN trail"<br>
            <br>
            Spaewife says, "Ulstram, dried meat"<br>
            <br>
            Spaewife nods.<br>
            <br>
            Zyllah says, "Lothwyn, you need to clean up...i can't even
            see the room in my screen."<br>
            <br>
            Nindy says, "I feel so dirty having not contributed to this
            mess."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Mmm, jerky."</span></font></p>
