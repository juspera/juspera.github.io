              not be packed with humor, but it's worth a look for the
              old names and gamemaster descriptions. The log is from one
              of the New Year's open house nights in the early 2000s.
              I've cut out most of the room descriptions for brevity's
              sake. If you would like to see them, please email me at
              gs4page@gmail.com and I will send you the unedited logs.</i><br>
            <br>
            Nilven says, "Was that "cool?""<br>
            <br>
            You scowl at Nilven.<br>
            <br>
            Nilven raises an eyebrow.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "EVERYone can do that."<br>
            <br>
            Nilven rubs his chin thoughtfully.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Jharra had a platypus."<br>
            <br>
            Nilven asks, "So?"<br>
            <br>
            You glance at Nilven.<br>
            <br>
            Nilven exclaims, "It's a platypus for Arkati's sake!"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I have to go look for more GMs."<br>
            <br>
            You give Nilven a quick little smooch.<br>
            <br>
            Nilven says, "Yeah, it's not like it's a super thingamabober
            jig."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Yeah."<br>

            [Jineer's Woods, Clearing Edge]<br>
            At the edge of the clearing, a dingy hammock is strung
            between two trees.&nbsp; A large stump serving as a
            makeshift table sits next to it.&nbsp; On the stump is a
            book and a glass of iced tea. &nbsp;<br>
            Obvious paths: west<br>
            <br>
            A shaft of scintillating light suddenly jumps out of the sky
            and strikes the ground next to you.&nbsp; The beam of light
            then explodes in a shower of sparks and Nilven is standing
            in its place.<br>
            <br>
            You shriek!<br>
            <br>
            Nilven fires a small halfling at you!<br>
            &nbsp; AS: +5042 vs DS: +38 with AvD: +25 + d100 roll: +38 =
            +5067<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; ... and hits for 1391 points of damage!<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Incredible shot impales a kidney.&nbsp; Too
            painful to even scream.<br>
            The buzz of thoughts in your mind subsides.<br>
            <br>
            It seems you have died, my friend.&nbsp; Although you cannot
            do anything, you are keenly aware of what is going on around
            you...<br>
            <br>
            You mentally give a sigh of relief as you remember that the
            Goddess Lorminstra owes you a favor.<br>
            <br>
            ...departing in 10 mins...<br>
            The small halfling sticks in Juspera.<br>
            <br>
            You exclaim, "No no no!"<br>
            <br>
            Nilven grins.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "..."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Okay, you're cool now."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "But if you healed me you'd be even cooler."<br>
            <br>
            You are healed.<br>
            <br>
            You nod.<br>
            <br>
            You dust yourself off.<br>
            <br>
            Nilven says, "Gimme my halfling back."<br>
            <br>
            You are wearing a small halfling, a silver-edged black sword
            pin, a coiled argent dragon tattoo, a cloak, a frog skin
            pouch, a platinum-set mistwood ring, a burnished imflass
            buckler, a tightly woven fishnet satchel, an Argent Aspis
            pin, a silk-lined imflass mail bodice, a knee-length blue
            velvet skirt, some light pliant brigandine laced over the
            open joints in braided suede, a gold ring and a
            silver-inlaid pale sapphire choker.<br>
            <br>
            You shudder.<br>
            <br>
            You lick the small halfling.<br>
            It tastes metallic!<br>
            <br>
            &gt;l half<br>
            You see nothing unusual.<br>
            <br>
            You offer your small halfling to Nilven, who has 30 seconds
            to accept the offer.&nbsp; Type CANCEL to prematurely cancel
            the offer.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "It tastes metallic."<br>
            <br>
            Nilven has accepted your offer and is now holding a small
            halfling.<br>
            <br>
            Nilven asks, "What are you doing killing halflings?"<br>
            <br>
            Nilven raises an eyebrow.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Well."<br>
            <br>
            Nilven says, "Licking even."<br>
            <br>
            Nilven says, "I don't know why I said killing."<br>
            <br>
            Nilven says, "I have killing on the mind."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "It had blood on it."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Come on, I have to find Jineer."<br>
            <br>
            Nilven joins your group.</span></font></p>

            [Jineer's Woods, Old Dock]<br>
            The forest ends at a clear, still lake, the moonlight
            reflecting gently on the water.&nbsp; A dugout canoe bumps
            against a rickety dock extending out into the water.&nbsp;
            The rasping croaks of frogs, hiding along the tree-lined
            bank, shatter the stillness.&nbsp; You also see a teeny tiny
            little red bikini, a large battered sign and a clear lake.<br>
            Also here: Jaxia, GameMaster Bradach who is sitting,
            Perigourd, GameMaster Jineer<br>
            Obvious paths: east<br>
            Nilven followed.<br>

            <br>
            &gt;l jin<br>
            You see GameMaster Jineer Whistletoe, a Sylvan ranger as
            ageless as the forest she inhabits.&nbsp; Her long, blonde
            hair has bits of leaves and twigs caught in the braids and
            her bright blue eyes sparkle with mischief.<br>
            She is wearing a large opossum dangling from her belt by its
            tail, a shimmering glaesine orb, a rough birch-bark quiver,
            a pair of tall scuffed black boots, a golden falcon talon
            pendant, a moss covered birch-bark knapsack, a small suede
            herb pouch attached to a leather thong, some scuffed
            blood-stained leather hunts, an elegant belt of twined ivy,
            a stunning cloak of leaves, a somewhat tattered falcon
            feather earring, a loosely woven bow sling, and a small
            chipmunk curled up fast asleep on her shoulder.<br>
            <br>
            Bradach says, "Perigourd, show that to Jineer."<br>

            You say, "Jineer."<br>

            You say, "There's a space in your description."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "But, I knew you were spacey already."<br>
            <br>
            Jaxia is apparently wrestling with a clear lake.<br>
            <br>
            Jineer glances at Bradach.<br>

            You see GameMaster Nilven Nalvin.<br>
            He appears to be a Dark Elf.<br>
            He appears to be wizened with age.&nbsp; He has brooding
            black eyes and fair skin.&nbsp; He has short, dark brown
            hair.<br>
            He is in good shape.<br>
            He is holding a miniature catapult in his left hand.<br>
            He is wearing a cheat fig leaf, a large sack, some glossy
            black leather boots, a supple white leather tabard, a
            shimmering glaesine orb, a gold star, a deep blue leather
            jerkin, some baggy blue striped trousers, a linen pouch, an
            engraved fel butterfly amulet, a belt pouch, a heavy
            backpack, and some flowing robes.<br>

            You say, "Hit Jaxia with the halfling."<br>
            <br>
            Bradach says, "Well, maybe not.&nbsp; But I didn't do it."<br>
            <br>
            Jaxia says, "I'm too nice to hit with a halfling."<br>

            Nilven says, "I want to hit a halfling. That'd be halfling
            on halfling violence."<br>
            <br>
            A shaft of scintillating light suddenly jumps out of the sky
            and strikes the ground next to you.&nbsp; The beam of light
            then explodes in a shower of sparks and Ildran is standing
            in its place.<br>
            <br>
            Jineer says, "Don't you hit any of the wildlife around here
            with that thing!"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I'm so cool, all the GMs want to be with me."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Not THAT way."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "But, you know."<br>
            <br>
            Ildran surveys the area.<br>
            <br>
            &gt;l ildran<br>
            You see GameMaster Ildran Thardmoor the Sorcerer.<br>
            He appears to be a Human from Talador.<br>
            He appears to be in the prime of life and taller than
            average.&nbsp; He has sparkling brown eyes and ivory
            skin.&nbsp; He has shoulder length, silky amber hair.&nbsp;
            He has a classical nose and broad shoulders.<br>
            He is in good shape.<br>
            He is holding an elegant onyx cane in his right hand.<br>
            He is wearing a big bright yellow star with AGM ILDRAN
            scorched across it, an elegant forest green longcoat, some
            slightly faded casting leathers, a bag of tricks, a keepsake
            satchel, some tailored black pants, and some polished black
            boots.<br>
            <br>
            Ildran says, "Actually, just looking for Nilven"<br>
            <br>
            Nilven says, "Don't make me kill you with a halfling again."<br>
            <br>
            Ildran waves a hand at you, dismissing you indifferently.<br>
            <br>
            Jineer points at Nilven.<br>
            <br>
            Jineer says, "He's here"<br>
            <br>
            You remove a silver pickle from in your imflass mail bodice.<br>
            <br>
            Ildran asks, "Is he really?"<br>
            <br>
            Taking hold of your silver pickle, you pretend to shove it
            into your ear while secretly transferring it to your other
            hand.&nbsp; With a smirk, you open your previously empty
            hand to display the pickle.<br>
            Roundtime: 2 sec.<br>
            <br>
            Bradach says, "Juspera Picklebrain."<br>

            Dreamrock falls over.<br>

            Nilven says, "I'm glad that you're the one that has to deal
            with her most of the year."<br>
            <br>
            Nilven nods to Bradach.<br>
            <br>
            You stare at nothing in particular.<br>
            <br>
            Bradach says, "Well.&nbsp; I've never seen THAT before."<br>
            <br>
            Jineer says, "You be polite to my guests Bradach, or I won't
            invite you back"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "No, he wishes."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I'm hardly ever in the Rest."<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "Bradach, do you have a place?"<br>
            <br>
            Jaxia says, "They don't let me out of Rivers Rest anymore."<br>
            <br>
            You rub Jaxia tenderly.<br>
            <br>
            Bradach says, "I do...but it's not open to the public."<br>
            <br>
            Jineer says, "His maid quit"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Oooooo."<br>

            Jaxia says, "I haven't been there since the last time."<br>

            Jineer says, "And no way was I going to help him clean that
            place"<br>
            <br>
            Bradach says, "I have only two or three rooms the public can
            enter."<br>

            [The Crossroads]<br>
            The soft white mist that seems to sparkle with a faint glow
            lazily reaches this far and continues to extend in every
            direction as far as you can see, and several new portals
            open up before you, leading to mysterious places.&nbsp;
            Which will you approach next?&nbsp; You also see a large
            corridor leading back to the main entry.<br>

            Dense trees and underbrush fill this lowland vale, allowing
            little light to filter through.&nbsp; The forest is alive
            with the rustling sounds of night creatures.&nbsp; On the
            west side of the trail a small hillock rises up and closer
            inspection reveals a golden light coming from what appears
            to be a narrow cave entrance.&nbsp; You also see a forest

            The trees fall back and give way to a small forest
            meadow.&nbsp; A gentle night breeze ruffles the meadow
            grasses and wildflowers as bats dart through the air.&nbsp;
            A small stream wanders out from among the trees and crosses
            the meadow.&nbsp; You also see a forest path and some

            Moonlight streams through the trees into this small glen,
            where grassy banks line the burbling brook as it drains into
            a crystal clear pool.&nbsp; The distant howl of a lone wolf
            fills the air and a light wind creates a soft accompaniment
            of rustling leaves.&nbsp; A giant weeping willow tree grows
            next to the pool, its branches creating a private
            bower.&nbsp; You also see some stepping stones.<br>

            Despite the humble entrance, this cave is surprisingly
            lavish and well appointed.&nbsp; Grey stone walls are
            brightened with expensive tapestries and paintings, while
            colorful Loenthran carpets stretch out over the floor.&nbsp;
            An inviting arrangement of large armchairs and settees
            surrounds a low mahogany table in the center of the
            room.&nbsp; Ornate glass lamps cast a warm light and a
            cheery fire burns in the elaborate river stone hearth.&nbsp;
            The only thing out of place is the stack of labeled crates
            along one wall.&nbsp;&nbsp; You also see a small opening and

            The roots of the dead mistwood tree rise briefly above the
            ground near a sparkling pool.&nbsp; Cattails drape their
            narrow green leaves over the agates that line the pool, and
            moonlight glimmering off the waters reflects against the
            pebble-sized rocks.&nbsp; Lush green water weeds sway in a
            slow current underwater, and dark brown mammalian forms may
            be seen swimming blithely beneath the surface.&nbsp; An onyx
            bench crafted in the shape of a rearing storm griffin
            overlooks the peaceful scene.&nbsp; You also see the spotted

            creature prances, prowls, hops about, or merely
            snoozes.&nbsp; The number of species represented here would
            shame the best zoo in mortal Elanthia.&nbsp; Leafless
            mistwood branches forking dozens of feet overhead cast
            amorphous shadows over the dandelion-speckled grass.&nbsp;

            save the tree trunks stretching up through the eastern
            briared wall.&nbsp; You also see the spotted Turinrond disk
            and the spotted Jacinto disk.<br>
            Also here: Lord Turinrond, Jacinto, Tierus who is lying down<br>
            Obvious paths: southwest, northwest<br>
            Aramana followed.<br>
            <br>
            You point at Tierus.<br>
            <br>
            Jacinto exclaims, "Darn Platypus!"<br>
            <br>
            Jharra just kissed Tierus.<br>
            Tierus returns to his Dark Elf form.<br>
            <br>
            Turinrond bats his eyelashes for attention.<br>
            <br>
            Lady Angelrise just arrived.<br>
            <br>
            Tierus stands up.<br>
            <br>
            Tierus stares off into space.<br>
            <br>
            Angelrise flails her arms about.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Oh, damn."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "He's an elf again."<br>
            <br>
            Tierus exclaims, "Goin' tae kill tha' platypus!"<br>
            <br>
            Jacinto exclaims, "You didn't kiss me!"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "No, I have to go."<br>
            <br>
            Angelrise says, "We were gonna find the ballroom again."<br>
            <br>
            You wave.<br>
            <br>
            [The Crossroads]<br>
            Your skin tingles as you step into a soft white mist that
            seems to sparkle with a faint glow.&nbsp; The mist extends
            in every direction as far as you can see, and there are
            several portals close at hand leading to mysterious
            places.&nbsp; Do you dare venture further?&nbsp; You take a
            deep breath as you carefully consider your choices.&nbsp;
            You also see a large corridor leading off through the mist
            to exotic places, a LARGE sign and a small arch leading to
            the Crossroads Lounge.<br>
            Also here: Lord Shonison, Bracan, Lauralinn, Dreamrock<br>
            Obvious exits: out<br>
            <br>
            Rekarth fades into view...&nbsp; Spooky!<br>
            <br>
            You laugh out loud!<br>
            <br>
            You hear the voice of Rekarth say, "Curious."<br>
            <br>
            Leandro fades into view...&nbsp; Spooky!<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Come out, come out."<br>
            <br>
            Thoroch fades into view...&nbsp; Spooky!<br>
            <br>
            Pookisa fades away into nothingness...&nbsp; Creepy!<br>
            <br>
            You tap your foot impatiently.<br>
            <br>
            You exclaim, "Come out!"<br>
            <br>
            How can they be so mean to you?!<br>
            <br>
            Rekarth suddenly fades into view.<br>
            <br>
            Rekarth surveys the area.<br>
            <br>
            &gt;lick rek<br>
            You stick your tongue out at Rekarth, bringing it back in at
            his lack of interest.<br>
            <br>
            Rekarth shifts his eyes to you.<br>
            <br>
            You smack your lips.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I have to go."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "If you see Lothwyn or Voraviel, tell them I'm
            going to kick their asses."<br>
            <br>
            You wave.<br>
            <br>
            Rekarth says, "Very well."<br>
            <br>
            Rekarth nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "You're a prince."</span></font></p>
