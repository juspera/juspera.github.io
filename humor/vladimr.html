            As you approach the entrance to the famed Duskruin Arena,
            something catches your eye! A weather-beaten covered wagon
            topped with a striped canopy, like a circus tent, belts out
            an off-key tune from a concealed calliope. A horde of
            adventurers crowd around it, jostling to view its wares. A
            tattered banner hangs from a flagpole and reads "Honest

            The wagon somehow seems smaller on the inside than the out.
            Thin plank shelves are suspended from the canopy walls,
            jostling with every footstep and threatening to spill their
            contents every which way. You also see a jeweled ring box,
            an armor stand, a weapon rack, a specialty chest, and a sign
            you really should read.<br>

            of the encampment's inhabitants lingers in the air, mixed
            with the aroma of cooked flesh and burning wood. A heavy
            grey haze of campfire smoke hangs over the warcamp and
            drifts down behind the rise of land, creating a pocket of
            concealment from the eyes of the nearby Grimswarm. You also
